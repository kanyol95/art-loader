Download and label the most popular paintings

This project created for personal use, but it could be helpful for else too. I wanted the learn the most popular paintings by artist and title. I thought the best way to learn is to use the labeled pictures as wallpapers.

The script scrapes WikiArt Popular Artworks list and find the images of the paintings with the biggest resolution. Then the script labels and saves these images first to a temporary folder, and then to a .zip file.
